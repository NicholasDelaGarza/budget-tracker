  ## Description
  
  This is a back-end NoSQL project that utilizes MongoDB and Mongoose to run a Progress Web App (PWA) that has functionality if no internet is available. Type in a title for the certain expense, the amount, and press subract or add funds depending on what the item entered is. The application will keep a running total of your balance and display a graph showing your budget. Go offline and this will still function as if it was online. 

  ## Installation

  To run this on your own computer you can copy the reop at https://github.com/cullinans1/budget-tracker. After that you will need to install npm, express, and mongoose.
